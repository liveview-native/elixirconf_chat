# ElixirconfChat

To start the ElixirConf Chat server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can use the app one of two ways:

- On the web, by visiting [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
- On iOS natively, by opening the Xcode project found in `native/swiftui` and running it in Simulator.

While the app is running in development mode, you can login using the test account `narwin@dockyard.com`. One-time login codes are sent to the Swoosh mailbox at [`localhost:4000/dev/mailbox`](http://localhost:4000/dev/mailbox).
